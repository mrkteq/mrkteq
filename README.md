# Mark Tucker | Web Development | Content Design

Based in Spain, I build clean, functional, and accessible web interfaces. My current work prioritises solid HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript fundamentals.

## Technical Focus

* Core: HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript.
* Standards: Mobile-first responsive design and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility.
* Performance: Auditing with Google Lighthouse to ensure high accessibility scores (89-98).
* AI Integration: Learning to leverage LLMs for rapid prototyping and creative direction, while ensuring I fully comprehend and can manually steer any generated code.

## Professional Background

From 2009 to 2020, I have contributed to high-traffic gambling platforms, 20+ UK council websites, and various SME business sites. My historical experience includes legacy technologies like AngularJS, jQuery, and XML templating - view my portfolio: https://github.com/mrkteq/web-developer
